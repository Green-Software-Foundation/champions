bio: |
 Hey all, I'm relatively new to green software. I pitched a new position to my high-performance computing team at the university where I work. I'll be looking into how to make our super computing facility a little more green. Right now I got a grant from Brown University to build out a carbon-aware super computer scheduler. I'll be presenting the SCI standard to our data science community here at Brown. And I've even got a (tiny) PR for `if-core`.  I'm looking for ways to broaden my impact at Brown and beyond. I thought this might be a fun way to get more involved with the green tech community
