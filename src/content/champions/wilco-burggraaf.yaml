    description: |
     Computing is more complex than it seems. It‚Äôs about managing workloads, how compute units work together‚Äîor sometimes shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîand how tasks queue up, much like waiting lines at grocery stores. The longer the queue, the more complex it becomes to make the right choices and manage the scenarios efficiently. We often assume more capacity or compute power leads to better energy use, but software and hardware don‚Äôt always align. Understanding how these queues are handled is key to improving both energy efficiency and performance.

Just as physicists grapple with reconciling the quantum realm with the grandeur of general relativity, so too must the software industry bridge the chasm between the micro-level energy consumption of code and the macro-level environmental impact of digital infrastructure. This complex interplay mirrors the quantum entanglement phenomenon, where seemingly disparate particles are intrinsically linked, their fates intertwined across vast distances.

    description: |
     "Do you know any product owners? Feel free to mention them in the comments!üåçüí° Let's discuss modern software development! üå± I strongly believe that impact awareness is key to transforming our approach to work. Understanding the effects‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîof our actions on the world around us is crucial.

     This awareness should prompt fundamental changes in how we operate, prioritizing it even above principles like reduce, reuse, and recycle (which are also very relevant in software development).

     What is impact? 
     To me, it's "the effect that people or things have on the natural world.""

    description: |
     "Sustainability: Not a Trend, But the New Normal. In today's business landscape, "sustainability" isn't merely a marketing buzzword ‚Äì it's the very foundation upon which businesses are constructed. Regulations such as the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) are now mandating transparency from large corporations regarding their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. But here's the crucial point: this mandate extends far beyond industry giants to encompass every link in the supply chain. As a supplier, recognizing and embracing this paradigm shift is your ticket to staying ahead in the game."

     In our climate-conscious tech landscape, "Building Green Software" by Anne Currie, Sarah Hsu, and Sara Bergman stands out. It dispels the myth of sustainable software being just about optimized code. This book delivers a holistic view emphasizing design choices, hardware implications, and how to align our work with the realities of energy systems.

     The Green Software Maturity Matrix (https://lnkd.in/eyh4kzkf), recently pointed out to me by Anne Currie (thanks! & cannot wait to read Building Green Software: A Sustainable Approach to Software Development and Operations 
     https://lnkd.in/eUNrYww5 ), is a beautiful tool for organizations on the sustainability journey. While initially, I saw it on the Green Software Foundation's project page, it somehow ended up at the back of my priority list of for example the Impact Framework and Awesome Green Software resources, because I love awesome software, but hey let's get back on track.

     The last 3 months have been an extraordinary journey.

     After deciding last year to pivot my career towards sustainability and nature-related topics, I found myself immersed in a world where ESG principles and the complexities of our energy consumption became the center of my focus.

     Discovering the Green Software Foundation's website was a turning point. A simple message I sent on the 30th of January to Asim Hussain about organizing a GSF Meetup in the Netherlands ignited a spark that has since grown into a deep passion. (https://lnkd.in/exsveCgs)

     I've been heavily researching everything hashtag#greenit, hashtag#greenops & hashtag#greensoftware including cloud. Then I stumbled upon the tool Cloud Carbon Footprint (CCF), it is free & open-source, and this is a nice environment to start measuring, the most important step in getting closer to knowing more about your company's digital footprint. It has proven itself and is well known in the circle of people talking about this subject online.

    subtitle: "The Green Mile: Streamlining Impact Framework Accessibility (Team: Green HighTech #Innovators) #66"
    description: |
     Summary | A brief overview of your project | 100

     The project tackles Impact Framework plugin challenges by re-engineering it into an accessible API for simpler manifest file creation and plugin development.

     It introduces four innovative sustainability plugins (vehicle-embodied carbon, weather impact prediction, EV charging emissions, and package delivery emissions) to boost sustainability efforts.

     Supported by a fictitious EV fleet sustainability case study, the project's clear README files and comprehensive analyses extend beyond carbon emissions to educate users.

     Additionally, a simulation API streamlines Impact Framework use and spur innovation.

     Concrete thought experiments inspire scientists to explore new uses of the Impact Framework by offering context, innovative modeling techniques, simulation basics, and simplified coding extensions through tangible examples.
