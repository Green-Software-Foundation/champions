bio: I'm Elena, an Italian soaking up the sun in Spain. With a degree in computer science, I delved into the world of Kotlin three years ago.
 Beyond coding, I'm deeply passionate about sustainability. I'm always exploring new ways to contribute to environmental conservation and for this reason I started studying about green computing. When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me indulging in my love for cats and nurturing my plant collection.
