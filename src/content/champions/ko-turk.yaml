    title: "From Space to Code: Using NASA's Open Data APIs with Kepler"
    description: |
     "Exploring NASA’s Open APIs for a Sustainable Future 🌍

     In this session, we explore NASA’s vast open APIs, unlocking data from across our solar system to build applications that educate, inspire, and promote sustainability.

     Key topics included:
     ✨ APOD – Stunning space imagery that reveals the universe’s mysteries.
     🔴 Mars Exploration – Insights into future missions and human habitation.
     🪐 Exoplanet Discoveries – The search for life beyond Earth.
     🌏 Earth Observation – Using satellite data to analyze climate and environmental health.

     We will demonstrate Kepler, a tool for measuring power efficiency in applications, helping developers optimize their impact.

     Harnessing NASA’s data, we took steps toward a more sustainable digital future, one line of code at a time! 🌱💡"
