    description: The goal of this project is to provide developers with hassle free, easy to use, ready to run tools for carbon aware computing. 

     This project will deliver a set of libraries, services and data. There are mostly extensions to other projects and all credits belong to them. To forecast the best execution time the Carbon Aware SDK from the Green Software Foundation is used. The Forecast data is from Energy Charts provided by Frauenhofer ISE.
