    title: Creation and lead of Amadeus Software Carbon Footprint Measurement project
    description: Created a virtual team of interns, apprentices, Software engineers & QA engineers to work on the implementation of the Software Carbon Intensity formula.
     Goal of the project is to provide Amadeus application owners the ability to easily monitor the carbon emissions of their applications, identify areas of improvement and evaluate the progress made thanks to the optimizations.
     An integration with the FinOps dashboard is planned in H1 2024 to support decisions taken based on financial aspects with a carbon emissions perspective.
