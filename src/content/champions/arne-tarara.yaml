    title: PowerHog
    subtitle: Energy consumption measurement during software development
    description: The power hog is a tool that periodically collects energy statistics of your mac and makes them available to you.
     There are two main aims - 
     Identify which apps are using a lot of energy on your machine.
     Collecting the data from as many machines as possible to identify wasteful apps globally.
     We provide a website for detailed analytics of your data. The hog by default uploads your measurement data to our Green Metrics Tool backend. We put in a lot of effort to make sure that no confidential information is exposed but please refer to the settings section if you want to disable the upload or submit the data to your own backend.

    description: "A tool that benchmarks various DBMS systems agains each other and looks at energy usage
     The compose.yml defines all the containers we want to use to benchmark. We use the std containers provided by the various DBMS and the hammerdb container. For benchmarking we use the hammerDB system.
     Currently we support:

     MariaDB
     MySql
     PostgreSQL

     The benchmarking is done via the standardised TPC-C Benchmark"

    title: Green software engineering
    description: The Green Metrics Tool is an open source framework that allows for measuring, comparing and optimizing the energy consumption of arbitrary software. The goal is to empower both software engineers and users to make educated decisions about libraries, code-snippets and software in order to save energy and thus carbon emissions.
