    title: Only intelligent digitzation is climate protection
    description: "„Nur intelligente Digitalisierung ist Klimaschutz!“ 
     This is the german headline of the article by Welt editor Norbert Lossau on digital sustainability in the WISSEN section. CEO Arne Tarara was able to share his thoughts and information on the topic of green coding with him. The message: any unnecessary use of IT should be avoided. Promoting climate protection requires intelligent digitalization!"

    title: "BEYOND BUZZWORDS: MAKING DIGITAL SUSTAINABILITY A REALITY"
    description: "Many teams within our community understand the necessity of integrating their digital products into their sustainability strategies. However, in a series of recent interviews with product teams, we revealed a disconnect between awareness and action. Sounds familiar? The reasons, though straightforward, pose significant challenges:
     Development hurdles: Building digital products is inherently time-consuming and expensive, leading to a culture of “scoping” and prioritizing core business needs. This can unintentionally exclude sustainability features.
     Knowledge gap: PMs and sustainability managers often lack the technical expertise to articulate relevant solutions for their specific tech stack and codebase, with devs responding with the “you-have-no-idea-what-you’re-talking-about” eyebrow raise
     In this 90-minute learning session, we are aiming to bridge that gap and empower both sides to bring the topic back into your next sprint planning!"

    title: Green Metrics Tool - Feature Live Demo
    description: "We had the opportunity to present at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation - TAG Environmental Sustainability (https://tag-env-sustainability.cncf.io/) about energy and carbon measurement of open source software.

     In the presentation we go over all the feature that the Green Metrics Tool provides including:
     - Energy measurement
     - Carbon measurement
     - Embodied carbon
     - Modular architecture
     - Statistical comparisons
     - Timeline view
     - DevOps Integrations
     - Optimizations
     - and much more

     The live demo with all features is linked on the project page to our Green Metrics Tool https://www.green.coding.io/projects/green-metrics-tool"

    title: Green Coding Bootcamp / Workshop
    description: "Green Coding Berlin will introduce its Green Metrics Tool, EcoCI and other methods for measuring environmental impact on the backend.

     First session: introducing hardware and software concepts to read energy data with further steps to convert it to CO2 metrics. Also indirect energy metrics from network and cloud services are discussed with current approaches to approximate them using linear and non-linear machine learning models.

     Second session: the Green Metrics Tool and ECO-CI will be used hands-on to measure container based software as well as a standard Github/Gitlab CI/CD pipeline. The hands-on session will feature setting up these tools, generating measurements, comparing metrics and understanding typical caveats when conducting energy and CO2 measurements of software."

    title: PowerHog
    subtitle: Energy consumption measurement during software development
    description: The power hog is a tool that periodically collects energy statistics of your mac and makes them available to you.
     There are two main aims - 
     Identify which apps are using a lot of energy on your machine.
     Collecting the data from as many machines as possible to identify wasteful apps globally.
     We provide a website for detailed analytics of your data. The hog by default uploads your measurement data to our Green Metrics Tool backend. We put in a lot of effort to make sure that no confidential information is exposed but please refer to the settings section if you want to disable the upload or submit the data to your own backend.

     Currently we support:

     MariaDB

     The benchmarking is done via the standardised TPC-C Benchmark"
