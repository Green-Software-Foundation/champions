bio: |
 I am a technical architect with 20 years of experience in Accenture. As the Nordic Sustainability Lead in Accenture Technology I am focusing on how we can help our clients use technology to enable and accelerate the implementation of sustainability use cases and solutions, while ensuring that we apply the technology in a fair and sustainable manner. 

 Also spending a significant amount of time to raise awareness and build a Green Software community within (and outside of) Accenture. As one of the largest employing organizations in the world, working with "all" the largest companies globally, our potential positive handprint is enormous. 

 Technology has been a massive driver for innovation and development in our society in the recent decades, and its pace of growth is quicker than ever. As part of the tech industry we have an opportunity and obligation to ensure that technology is used sustainably and responsibly, and that the positive effects exceeds the potential negative impacts.
