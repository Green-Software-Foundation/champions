bio: I'm Francesco Fullone, a business designer, consultant, entrepreneur, and investor in technology companies focusing on sustainability or social impact. I help companies to better define their business propositions to create options to validate them, and I advise them to organize themselves better to reach their goals. I founded different companies - Apropos to help communities, companies, and local groups organize events and workshops; Digitiamo to create NLP and AI-related products; Ideato (sold), where I contributed to its growth for more than ten years, creating an innovative and quality reference for the development agencies in Italy. I'm the president of the GrUSP.org, a non-profit association that encourages best practices and inclusivity in web development since 2002.
