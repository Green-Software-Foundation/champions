    title: "Be the Change Our Planet Seeks: How YOU Can Contribute to Running Environment-Friendly Workloads on Kubernetes"
    description: Climate change affects us all and it’s impact can be seen throughout all aspects of our life, including software engineering. Reducing carbon footprint and following sustainable software engineering principles is now a part of every software company’s goal, but do you know that YOU, as a developer or a platform engineer, have all the power to contribute to making your technical platform and this world a better, greener place? Kubernetes is one of the technologies that comes in multiple flavors, but it’s up to YOU to utilize it in a way that will lessen harmful impacts of global warming. During this session Kristina will shed light on how sustainable software engineering principles can be applied to Kubernetes and it’s workloads, as well as which eye-opening insights she has gained during her Kubernetes journey and what concrete actions you can take with you and apply further in your projects after the conference in order to make your Kubernetes workloads more eco-friendly.
