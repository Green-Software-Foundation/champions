    title: "nCast Episode 12: Optimizing for Sustainability"
    description: Kristina Devochko joins nCast podcast episode to talk all things cloud cost optimization, Kubernetes and green tech. We start by talking about the fact that many companies aren’t even using HALF of their compute resources. But does slashing your public cloud bill always mean that you’re saving the plant? We delve into cost optimization and how it aligns (or not) with sustainability. Kristina shares her insights on measuring your cloud carbon footprint and the tools you need (KEDA, Karpenter, Kepler) to increase cloud sustainability. We discuss key practical ways to get started cutting unnecessary cloud waste, from eliminating orphaned resources to utilizing spot instances and scheduling during off hours.

    title: Debunking Myths About Environmental Sustainability in the Cloud, Building a Greener CNCF Landscape
    description: Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important topic in general and in the cloud native and open source realm as well. However, with the steadily growing attention to the topic, misconceptions and doubts appear regarding the actual impact of proposed actions that are meant to promote environmental sustainability in the cloud. We would like to put our myth-busting hats on to address and debunk some of these misconceptions. We will provide an objective, evidence-based understanding of the real implications some actions may have on environmental sustainability in the cloud-native context. Join the Cloud Native Sustainability Mythbusters Squad, bring your open mind, discover facts, challenge assumptions, and contribute to a more informed and greener community.

    title: "Be the Change Our Planet Seeks: How YOU Can Contribute to Running Environment-Friendly Workloads on Kubernetes"
    description: Climate change affects us all and it’s impact can be seen throughout all aspects of our life, including software engineering. Reducing carbon footprint and following sustainable software engineering principles is now a part of every software company’s goal, but do you know that YOU, as a developer or a platform engineer, have all the power to contribute to making your technical platform and this world a better, greener place? Kubernetes is one of the technologies that comes in multiple flavors, but it’s up to YOU to utilize it in a way that will lessen harmful impacts of global warming. During this session Kristina will shed light on how sustainable software engineering principles can be applied to Kubernetes and it’s workloads, as well as which eye-opening insights she has gained during her Kubernetes journey and what concrete actions you can take with you and apply further in your projects after the conference in order to make your Kubernetes workloads more eco-friendly.
