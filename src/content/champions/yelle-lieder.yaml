    title: Trade offs in the development of sustainable software
    subtitle: Evaluation of practices to improve the environmental sustainability of cloud applications
    description: This paper examines the trade-offs between sustainability and quality when applications are developed for operation in the cloud. To this end, three specific practices are evaluated in terms of conflicting objectives and recommendations for developers are drawn up on how they can identify and deal with the occurrence of conflicting objectives in practice. Specifically, the explicit planning of the consumption of electricity with low CO2 intensity, the use of procedural instead of object-oriented programming and the bundling of network packages are evaluated. The results of the 12 identified impacts offer developers guidance in identifying conflicting goals and evaluating their own practices and applications.

    description: Python project that uses historical electricity market data and weather data to predict when the co2 intensity in the grid will be low. An API can be used to specify the earliest_start and latest_end times as well as the expected duration of the job and the geo coordinates of the data center. The system then returns a recommendation as to when it is most environmentally sustainable to start the job.

    title: Sustainable Software Engineering Literature Review
    subtitle: Practices to increase environmental sustainability in software engineering
    description: In a systematic literature search across four databases, 33 papers were identified from 3464 initial search hits that suggest practices for improving energy behavior. Ultimately, 56 specific practices were identified that positively influence the energy behavior of software. All practices found were embedded in a taxonomy and, where possible, assessed in the dimensions of scope, efficiency, proven effectiveness and effort. The developed taxonomy provides an overview of the different application areas of the practices and allows readers to quickly identify practices relevant to their use case. Many of the practices found have a high degree of effectiveness and are not limited to a specific use case. The research shows that there is a clear focus on the reduction of power consumption and that the power source is hardly considered in software engineering research.
