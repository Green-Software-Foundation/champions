bio: |
 I am a researcher and a graduate student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. My research focuses on green software and sustainable computing, especially from the hardware and system software stack perspective. I have been working in green software for the past 6 years, starting as a Google Summer of Code student with the GNOME Foundation, where I built a kernel module to estimate the energy consumed by an application in the Linux kernel. In addition, I have three years of professional experience in highâ€‘performance code optimization and three years of research experience in computer architecture and operating systems. I have delivered more than 10 talks worldwide on my research in green software and sustainable computing.
