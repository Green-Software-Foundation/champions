     "Details
     Two exciting topics, two very experienced speakers and much networking opportunity. We are very much looking forward to the next DevOps Meetup Zurich. Here's what's planned for the evening:

     17:30 - 18:00 - Arrival and first drinks

     18:00 - 18:45 - The environmental impact of software by Christian Abegg

     18:45 - 19:30 - Carbon Measurement And Attribution For Processes And Hardware Devices In The Linux Kernel by Aditya Manglik

     19:30 - 20:30 - Networking, Open Space & More drinks

     The environmental impact of software by Christian Abegg
     At first glance, the IT industry seems to be a relatively clean sector. However, the development and operation of software have a significant environmental impact that is often overlooked. In this talk, we will explore the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated along the software lifecycle, and discuss ways to reduce it with measures ranging from coding over datacenter operation to the way individuals are working. By the end of the presentation, attendees will have an overview of the key factors, as well as actionable suggestions for addressing them.

     Christian Abegg
     Christians passion is sustainable software engineering. He's convinced that everyone's contribution is required to tackle the climate crisis. In his role as lead architect at Zühlke, he focuses on continuously improving quality, providing rock-solid architectures, writing the right tests and setting up reliable build pipelines. He never ceases to be amazed by what people can achieve together when they collaborate and work to each other’s strengths.

     Carbon Measurement And Attribution For Processes And Hardware Devices In The Linux Kernel by Aditya Manglik
     This talk details the development of carbon and energy measurement infrastructure in the Linux kernel. The objective is to determine the energy consumption and link it to carbon emissions of hardware devices and software applications (processes). This infrastructure allows the programmers and users to see which hardware devices and processes are responsible for the system’s energy consumption and carbon emissions. These statistics are extremely useful for both user-level applications and kernel developers.
