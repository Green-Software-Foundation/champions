    description: |
     "The Impact Framework is a tool designed to measure and report the carbon emissions generated by software applications. It provides a comprehensive and transparent methodology for quantifying the environmental footprint, helping organizations to understand and mitigate their impact on climate change. This talk will delve into the workings of the Impact Framework, explaining its key features and benefits. We will also walk through a real-world case study, demonstrating how the tool has been applied to assess and reduce the carbon emissions of a specific software project. Attendees will gain valuable insights into the role of the Impact Framework in sustainable software development.

    title: "Green IT Revolution? Software Carbon Intensity, PageSpeed Insights, KEIT, Kepler"
    description: |
     "As the digital landscape evolves, the environmental implications of software development have become increasingly significant. This paper examines the concept of Green Software, which aims to minimize the carbon footprint associated with software applications.  

     A key component of this initiative is the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI), a metric that assesses the carbon emissions generated during the operation of software. We explore the methodologies for calculating SCI and highlight essential metrics and KPIs‚Äîsuch as execution time, resource utilization, and geographical factors‚Äîthat are crucial for monitoring sustainability in software systems.

     Furthermore, we discuss a range of tools designed to facilitate the measurement of energy consumption and carbon footprints, including PageSpeed Insights, Cloud Carbon Footprint, KEIT, and Kepler. These tools enable developers to understand the interplay between coding practices and energy efficiency, illustrating how optimized code can lead to reduced energy consumption and lower environmental impact.

     The paper concludes with key takeaways that underscore the importance of integrating sustainable practices into software development. Additionally, we provide a selection of certifications, books, and resources that offer further insights into Green Software, empowering developers to advance their knowledge and application of eco-friendly coding techniques."

    title: "Green Coding: Creating Sustainable Apps"
    description: |
     Over the past several years, we have been facing the consequences of climate change and resource depletion. This change is strongly linked to human activity and the resulting CO2 emissions.

     All sectors are concerned, and many are beginning to reduce their impacts on the environment, resources, and biodiversity.

     Our digital sector, accounting for approximately 4% of the global share, significantly contributes to emissions. It is for this reason that GreenIT initiatives have emerged, and they continue to improve and yield results.

     Nevertheless, every individual in our sector, at their own level and in their own role, must do their part to reduce the impact of their work on the environment. As Software Engineers, we must consider the concepts of green coding and integrate them into our array of best engineering practices.

     It is within this framework that I am publishing the first article in a series of 7 articles, at a pace of one article per month. These articles will address green coding, its principles, and its application in everyday life.

     In the continuation of this article, we will specifically discuss green coding, how it is defined, and how it is applied in practice, based on examples in Java. However, it is important to note that these principles are language-independent
