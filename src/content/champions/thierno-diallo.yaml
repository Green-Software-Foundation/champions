    title: Introduction to Green Software Craftmanship Approaches
    description: The Green Software Craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the eco-responsibility of our applications by minimizing their environmental impacts. This can include practices such as reducing energy consumption, efficient resource management, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and minimizing electronic waste. In other words, it is about sustainable and eco-responsible software development, considering the environmental impact at every stage of the development process.

    description: |
     The main goal was 
     To presente green software best patterns that we are implementing or we intend to implement to our vendors/suppliers
     To inform them the minimal green software practicies, learning and training that must have thier employees working with us.
     The last one was the inform our top management about the local Green Software Champions Items advancement

    title: "Green Coding: Creating Sustainable Apps"
    description: |
     Over the past several years, we have been facing the consequences of climate change and resource depletion. This change is strongly linked to human activity and the resulting CO2 emissions.

     All sectors are concerned, and many are beginning to reduce their impacts on the environment, resources, and biodiversity.

     Our digital sector, accounting for approximately 4% of the global share, significantly contributes to emissions. It is for this reason that GreenIT initiatives have emerged, and they continue to improve and yield results.

     Nevertheless, every individual in our sector, at their own level and in their own role, must do their part to reduce the impact of their work on the environment. As Software Engineers, we must consider the concepts of green coding and integrate them into our array of best engineering practices.

     It is within this framework that I am publishing the first article in a series of 7 articles, at a pace of one article per month. These articles will address green coding, its principles, and its application in everyday life.

     In the continuation of this article, we will specifically discuss green coding, how it is defined, and how it is applied in practice, based on examples in Java. However, it is important to note that these principles are language-independent
