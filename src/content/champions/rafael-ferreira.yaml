bio: |
 Hi, I’m Rafael, a curious and good-humored individual who has always been fascinated by understanding how things work. At the age of nine, I received my first computer, which sparked my passion for turning the impossible into reality.

 Throughout my career, I’ve worked in multinational companies, consulting firms, and international corporate environments. My focus has been on driving digital transformation through innovative cloud solutions that meet the demands of an ever-evolving market.

 Although I don't yet work directly with Green Software in my daily routine, I dedicate part of my time studying and advocating for sustainable software practices, especially from a DevOps and infrastructure perspective. I'm passionate about the role that cloud optimization, efficient architectures, and automation play in reducing the environmental impact of digital systems. I regularly explore and share insights on the topic through blog posts, talks, and community engagements.
