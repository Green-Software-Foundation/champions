bio: I‚Äôm a passionate Engineer and Engineering Manager with nearly 20 years of experience, focusing on optimising architecture and infrastructure (containers and VMs) as well as processes (pipelines and deployments). My career journey has been quite diverse, moving from freelancing to various roles such as employee, start-up founder, CTO, and alternating between software engineering and management. This varied experience has given me hands-on exposure across numerous industries and markets, helping me develop a thorough understanding of the entire web application life cycle, from gathering requirements to maintenance. My primary focus is bringing value by helping engineering teams in delivering value faster with higher standards.
