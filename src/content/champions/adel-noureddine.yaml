 Dr Adel Noureddine is an Associate Professor in computer science at the University of Pau and Pays de lâ€™Adour, France. He holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Lille and Inria in 2014, and has worked in computer science in France and the UK, and in the private and public sector.
 His main research areas are around green IT and green software engineering, behavioral computer science, empirical software engineering, and autonomic computing. In particular, he is interested in the role of software and its generated data in energy-efficient, green, autonomous and smart adaptations in cyber-physical systems.

 He has been working on green IT and green software since 2010, and developed multiple software solutions for energy efficiency.
 Lately, he launched the Joular project. aiming to build robust tools to measure and analyze the energy consumption of software.
 He also created a course on Green IT in 2019 at the graduate master level, and a second one on sustainable computing in 2022. He founded a French national working group on green software in 2020, and a series of summer schools on green it since 2021.
