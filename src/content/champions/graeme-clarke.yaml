    title: Green Computing Manifesto
    description: Better quality software can significantly reduce the amount of energy used in computers through the reductions in CPU, fans, hard disk and interaction with physical devices.

     Bad-quality code can heat up CPUs, spin fans and hard disks and generate significant quantities of waste heat, light and mechanical energy.
     When scaling up across desktops, mobile and IOT devices, cars and big cloud data centres, making savings can have a huge impact.
     The Green Computing Manifesto empowers us to create more efficient, higher-quality software that uses fewer resources.

    title: Could Callous Computer Coding Kill the Climate?
    description: Climate change is on the agenda. Young girls to older TV wildlife presenters are galivanting around the world telling us we’re destroying the planet and shouting that we need to do something about it NOW! But sure, it’s all down to the coal-fired power stations and of course, those people who continue to drive around in big diesel engine cars. Those guys need to sit up and smell the coffee, turn things around and go out and buy a Prius or an ID3 (if they can get one)!

     Good job that software developers don’t generate any carbon. Or do they?
