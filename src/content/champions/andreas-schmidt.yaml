bio: |
 I studied Computer Science at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany. I did my PhD at the Telecommunications Lab at Saarland University, strongly collaborating with the Distributed Systems and Operating Systems Chair at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg. Most of this work was part of Energy-, Latency- And Resilience-aware Networking (e.LARN), a project within German Science Foundation's (DFG) priority programme 1914 "Cyber-Physical Networking". Afterwards, I joined the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in Kaiserslautern as a post-doctoral researcher.

 Since 2022, I am working at the Dependable Systems and Software Chair at Saarland University—first as a visiting professor and now as a group leader.

    title: Hey Siri, turn up the temperature!
    subtitle: How to Warm Your Planet with AI 
    description: "It is the year 2025: Ten years since the Paris Agreement, and over fifty since the Limits to Growth. Today, the headlines are dominated by the latest and greatest in artificial intelligence (AI), but also doomsday predictions on AI taking over everyone’s jobs. In this talk I take a critical look at the environmental implications of AI technology, which in many instances goes beyond what we know from classical, non-AI computing. After a general look at computing’s environmental impact, we take a closer look at the current sustainability of AI, where both embodied as well as operational resource demand and emissions will be investigated. Afterwards, various ways to make AI more sustainable are presented. Finally, a short detour is planned, covering „sustainable data centers“ as the physical hosts for AI training and serving."

    title: "Dirty Bits in Low-Earth Orbit: The Carbon Footprint of Launching Computers"
    description: "Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are increasingly proposed for communication and in-orbit computing, achieving low-latency global services. However, their sustainability remains largely unexamined. This paper investigates the carbon footprint of computing in space, focusing on lifecycle emissions from launch over orbital operation to re-entry. We present ESpaS, a lightweight tool for estimating carbon intensities across CPU usage, memory, and networking in orbital vs. terrestrial settings. Three worked examples compare (i) launch technologies (state-of-the-art rocket vs. potential next generation) and (ii) operational emissions of data center workloads in orbit and on the ground. Results show that, even under optimistic assumptions, in-orbit systems incur significantly higher carbon costs—up to an order of magnitude more than terrestrial equivalents—primarily due to embodied emissions from launch and re-entry. Our findings advocate for carbon-aware design principles and regulatory oversight in developing sustainable digital infrastructure in orbit."

    title: "Dirty Electrons: On the Carbon Intensity of Stored Energy"
    description: To reduce carbon emissions, system software must accurately trace and properly attribute these emissions to applications that cause energy consumption and hardware degradation. While the carbon intensity of the grid energy is readily available from online services, it is often overlooked that computing systems do not directly and immediately consume this energy. Instead, energy coming from the grid is first transformed by power supplies (PSUs) and then often stored in batteries.In this work, we investigate how PSUs and batteries affect the carbon intensity of the energy that actually powers the computer system. We analyze the extent to which specific hardware characteristics need to be taken into account in order to accurately attribute operational and embodied emissions to applications. To do this, we propose an analytical model for the carbon intensity of stored energy, which includes power supply and charging efficiency (which inflates operational emissions) and battery degradation (which causes embodied emissions). We conclude with a look at the future of system-level management of emissions caused by stored energy.
