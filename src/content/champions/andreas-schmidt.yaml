bio: |
 I studied Computer Science at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany. I did my PhD at the Telecommunications Lab at Saarland University, strongly collaborating with the Distributed Systems and Operating Systems Chair at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg. Most of this work was part of Energy-, Latency- And Resilience-aware Networking (e.LARN), a project within German Science Foundation's (DFG) priority programme 1914 "Cyber-Physical Networking". Afterwards, I joined the Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in Kaiserslautern as a post-doctoral researcher.

 Since 2022, I am working at the Dependable Systems and Software Chair at Saarland University—first as a visiting professor and now as a group leader.
