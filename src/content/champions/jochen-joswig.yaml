bio: I studied in San Francisco (USA), Jena (Germany) and Hamburg (Germany). During my studies, I realized the enormous potential of software and ICT to solve even the toughest of challenges. Since 2020, I became captivated by two questions. 1. How can software be applied to solve various sustainability issues? 2. How can one make software itself sustainable? The latter is especially interesting to me since I am myself a Software Developer. Therefore, I have become a founding member of the Green Software Manifesto (www.greenmanifesto.de) and I am researching and sharing ideas related to Green Software.

    description: How do you create awareness and make environmental sustainability a non-functional requirement? How can one adjust and build upon agile development practices to enable teams, to factor in the environmental sustainability of their decisions. My article published in the IT-Spektrum magazine (edition 02/2023) helps to answer those questions.

    description: There has been extensive research in recent years about Green Software. In my talk, I introduced some of the key ideas and methods from this research and made the matter of Green Software more accessible. Furthermore, I introduced some areas in which in my opinion research is still lacking and provided a personal view on how this could be changed.

    subtitle: How can software help with the green transformation
    description: The Elite graduate Program Software Engineering is backed by the University of Augsburg, the Technical University of Munich and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU). The students developed sustainability focused applications from the first idea to a working prototype. They were taught to consider not only the effects of using the software, but also the footprint of the software itself. Additionally, they were given the opportunity to learn more about sustainable leadership.
