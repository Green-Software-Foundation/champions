bio: |
 After my MSc in computer science engineering with a thesis about consumer cloud computing I got specialization in Cloud and Azure. 
 I wrote some books on Microsoft Azure, for K12 education and I train/speak for the developer community in Europe. 
 I hold several technical certifications on various vendors and I am an Azure MVP since 2010. 
 After 10 years working as a freelance consultant for major companies in Italy, I then co-launched ReStore as the CTO.
 Now I'm the CTO of Witailer, part of Retex Group, a leading company in the Amazon and eMarketplace services for brands in Italy.
