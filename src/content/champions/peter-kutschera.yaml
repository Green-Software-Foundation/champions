bio: I have worked for more than 25 years as a consultant and architect for different companies. My focus is the application architecture and the operation of enterprise applications, especially in the insurance sector. Knowledge in agile software development, cloud infrastructure and application performance management complete my knowledge. Since 2008, I am Open Group Certified Master Architect and for more than two years, I work as accredited trainer at ISAQB for CPSA-F. As a practice lead for Sustainable Software Architecture, I am very much interested in providing green software and helping to reduce the carbon emissions of software.

    title: Ist Clean gleich Green? – Wir haben nachgemessen
    description: |
     "Have you been using the Clean Architecture Pattern for years? Then you certainly know its advantages and disadvantages: It provides a clear structure, facilitates maintainability and clearly separates responsibilities. The advantages are valuable - and we have accepted the disadvantages.

     But have you ever asked yourself whether clean architecture is also ecologically sustainable? Does ‘clean’ automatically mean ‘green’?

     In our presentation, we will get to the bottom of this exciting question. We will look at different levels of architecture - from system architecture to integration architecture and application architecture - and analyse the impact that clean architecture has on the sustainability of software. We base our statements on concrete measurements and offer practical insights into how a well thought-out software architecture can contribute to ecological sustainability. "

    title: Wie Softwarearchitekten zur Nachhaltigkeit beitragen können
    description: |
     "The climate crisis is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels. However, the IT industry also contributes significantly to global carbon dioxide emissions. It is therefore important that we take measures to reduce CO2 emissions. This can only succeed if we see energy efficiency as part of our quality requirements. We achieve the best results when this aspect is taken into account in the requirements, architecture and implementation through to operation. "

    title: Nachhaltigkeit in der Softwareentwicklung – Produktqualitäten und Architekturtaktiken
    description: The demand for energy and resources in IT is constantly increasing. As digitisation continues, IT applications will account for an ever greater share of energy consumption. But how can sustainability taken into account during the architecture design? What does sustainability mean in the context of quality requirements that a software system has to meet? The goal of the talk is to show sustainability can be integrated in an existing quality model, the dependencies to existing quality attributes as well as possible solutions to implement the quality requirements.
