bio: |
 I first learned about the topic in mid 2023 when I joined Netlight and talked to a senior colleague about topic of sustainability. After that, I started researching and building knowledge in the field.
 I decided to spread the word around Green Software internally to upskill other Netlighters on the topic. I also started to reach out to Communities out there, building a network of contacts in the field.
 Since then, I've created an internal training for Green Software, have held several talks on the topic and published a whitepaper on it. I continue to be a champion for Green Software at Netlight and whereever I get the chance to do so.
