bio: Passionate tree hugger looking to drive more aware of sustainability concepts in the business world. I love to teach in general and especially love to introduce green software concepts to people that otherwise wouldn't take them into account. As part of SDG goal 17, I believe itâ€™s paramount to establish partnerships to grow sustainability value proposition, develop differentiated offerings and drive meaningful change that is good for the planet and the bottom line.
