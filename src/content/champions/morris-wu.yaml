bio: My primary role is as an Enterprise IT Architect in the financial industry, focusing on IT strategy planning and driving digital transformation initiatives. Starting in 2023, I participated in the CNCF Sustainability Community Forum held in Taiwan, where I shared practical experiences and professional insights on green software, and connected with Sarah, a member of the foundation. Subsequently, in 2024 and 2025, I actively participated in Taiwan's prominent community organization, iThome, where I organized and hosted the Tech Sustainability Summit and served as a speaker on sustainable software engineering topics. Additionally, I undertook the translation work for the book "Building Green Software", authored by foundation members Anne, Sara, and Sarah, which is soon to be officially published.
