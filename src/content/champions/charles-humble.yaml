bio: |
 " I am an IT industry veteran with 30 years' experience. A former software engineer, architect and CTO, I have worked as a senior leader and executive of both technology and content groups. I was InfoQ’s editor-in-chief from 2014-2020 championing InfoQ's early coverage of sustainability on the site and at QCon.

 From a green software point of view I have:
 Written "The Developer's Guide to Cloud Infrastructure, Efficiency and Sustainability" for The New Stack - https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/cloud-infrastructure/developers-guide-to-cloud-infrastructure-efficiency-and-sustainability/

 Written a number of articles about AI and sustainability such as: 
 https://thenewstack.io/ai-at-the-edge-federated-learning-for-greater-performance/
 https://thenewstack.io/ai-consumes-lots-of-energy-can-it-ever-be-sustainable/
 https://www.conissaunce.com/demand-shifting-and-shaping.html
 https://thenewstack.io/what-do-you-lose-when-you-abandon-the-cloud/

 In the last year I've given sustainability talks at GOTO Copenhagen, Devoxx London, and "AI for the rest of us".  Upcoming sustainability talks include  RepresentAI & Ladies of London Hacking Society, YOW! Melbourne, YOW! Brisbane, and YOW! Sydney

 Talk examples:

 I've also been on multiple podcasts, including environment variables to talk about the topic:

    title: Writing Greener Software Even When You Are Stuck On-Prem
    description: There is a real efficiency advantage in high compute density via managed cloud services. Such services, which can share resources between thousands or millions of users, can achieve extremely high hardware and energy utilisation. Because of this, an awful lot of the still rather limited publicly available material on writing software with sustainability in mind emphasises shifting to cloud services. But what happens if you can’t?

    title: What are Demand Shifting and Shaping in Green Software?
    description: "If you’ve ever looked at the Maturity Matrix produced by the Green Software Foundation (GSF), or spent time thinking about green software more broadly, you’ve probably come across the terms ‘Demand Shifting’ and ‘Demand Shaping’."
