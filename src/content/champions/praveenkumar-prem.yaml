bio: |
 I’m an AI-driven Quality Engineering leader with 20+ years’ experience helping organisations modernise, automate, and scale their engineering capabilities. Based in Sydney, I work with ANZ clients and Wipro’s global teams to drive QE transformation, enable intelligent test automation, and build future-ready QET organisations that deliver faster, safer, and more sustainably.

 Passionate about ethical, explainable AI, I help teams move from reactive testing to proactive quality engineering. I focus on measurable impact — improving reliability, accelerating release cycles, and embedding AI, automation, and green engineering principles across the delivery ecosystem.

 As a Delivery Leader and AI Transformation Partner managing a $15M P&L portfolio, I redefine how delivery creates strategic value, transforming Wipro into a trusted partner by driving AI-led innovation, operational excellence, and business outcomes. I lead programs to identify AI opportunities that improve client results and foster a change-ready, innovation-oriented culture within the delivery organisation.
