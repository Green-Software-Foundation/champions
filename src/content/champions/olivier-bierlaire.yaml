bio: |
 As a software engineer formerly with companies like Canva and Elastic, I have a strong background in DevOps and have worked extensively in both France and Australia. Recently, I have pivoted to focus on sustainability in IT. I founded Carbonifer to provide tools that optimize the cost, carbon emissions, and other impacts of cloud infrastructure. 

 Additionally, I am a regular speaker at tech conferences across Europe, including Devoxx, Devfest, and NDC, talking about sustainability in cloud computing. 

 I am also part of Carbon13, the Venture Builder for the Climate Emergency, in Berlin Cohort, where I collaborate with a cohort of over 80 founders to launch ventures capable of reducing CO2e emissions by 10 million tonnes annually at scale.
