bio: |
 I have a degree in Computer Science from EPFL (Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, Switzerland) and 25 years of experience in the IT industry, mainly in public transport systems and datacenter services. Over the years, I’ve become increasingly focused on the environmental impact of technology and how we can make IT more sustainable.

 I’m the founder of Perito IT, a consultancy that supports organizations in adopting Green-IT practices. I co-organized the ClimateAction.tech Green-IT Hackathon, co-founded the Way to Green IT education initiative, and am part of the Green-IT Community of Practice Switzerland. I'm also working on launching a Green-IT Meetup in Bern to bring practitioners together locally.

 Through my work, I aim to connect technical expertise with sustainability, helping teams and companies take practical steps toward greener software and infrastructure.

    subtitle: Measure Energy of LLMs challenges
    description: I organized this challenge and participated in the challenge itself during the hackathon. The challenge was to measure and improve the environmental impact of the Swiss Large Language Model (Apertus, from the Swiss AI Initiative) and compare it with other models. Participants should design methods to quantify energy consumption during inference. Then, prompts should be tested to see the impact of different prompt types.
