    title: "Accurately measuring your cloud activity’s full impact:  Wishful thinking?"
    description: Diane Sempéré, Head of Product and myself presented the new Environmental Footprint Calculator, created for Scaleway cloud clients by Diane's team, at Green IO Paris 2024. I began by pointing out that 65% of tech companies' emissions are simply not reported, whence the pressing need for transparent and full-scope reporting (not just all 3 scopes, but also hardware and water).

    subtitle: A round table organized by VivaTech, Europe’s biggest startups & tech event
    description: "I was invited to animate a round table with VivaTech delegates, to discuss how (generative) AI’s impact can be measured and limited.

Participants included a project manager from France’s Ministry for the Economy, who requested a follow-up discussion."
