    title: Beyond the Agile Principles 
    subtitle: Nature as a guide
    description: Its so easy to get pigeonhole in one thing, one way of seeing, one experience, one industry, one process, one org... In this talk we are going beyond the Agile principles, I'll introduce you to Biomimicry. These principles are everywhere, you'll gain HD glasses to spot them and apply them for any design. So we can leave 'the place better than how we found it'.Understanding these natural overarching principles can really help to gain headspace and intentionally design with purpose. From solutions, to applications, integrations, coordination, communications, networks, products and beyond
