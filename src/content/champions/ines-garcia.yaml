     In multi-tenant architectures there is a line of responsibility and feasibility for one to make changes. That is where lobbing, supplier procurement commitments and public pressure can move the needle.

     'Don't wash your hands of' so quickly, that's not it.

     There are in fact things to account and adjust at instance level, that is OUR responsibility.

     Today I want to introduce you to The Salesforce Developer Carbon Dashboard

     And THAT (chances are you are part of that 'large segment of the software-development ecosystem that cares') would be my first action oriented call for you, head over the Green Web Foundation and particularly take the course that is hosted in Linux Foundation.

     In essence we all are to half our emissions by 2030. Regardless of pledges, this is UN target which is legally binding. 

     We ALL, humans, as an individual, household, hobby activity, village, city, council, county, country, industry, company, department, product, team... ain't exceptions--half our emissions in all dimensions.

     No small task. No time to waste.

     Software is everywhere. I argue is no longer 'an industry' per se, but a fabric layer of any business. The question then becomes: how to half your software emissions.

    subtitle: Evolving Our Practice
    description: "As Agile practitioners product & organisation sustainability is our responsibility. In this session we will delve from the business case for Sustainability (& debunking top excuses) right into the responsibility in shaping efficient, modular and natural-capital aware products and systems. Not just by the mantra of “less is more” (simplifying & optimizing), we’ll explore the concept of Circular Economy and how can be applied to our daily practices. Skill up for what’s on-demand and what we ought to achieve within the next 6 years: The legally binding Paris Agreement. Not long!"

    title: Beyond the Agile Principles 
    subtitle: Nature as a guide
    description: Its so easy to get pigeonhole in one thing, one way of seeing, one experience, one industry, one process, one org... In this talk we are going beyond the Agile principles, I'll introduce you to Biomimicry. These principles are everywhere, you'll gain HD glasses to spot them and apply them for any design. So we can leave 'the place better than how we found it'.Understanding these natural overarching principles can really help to gain headspace and intentionally design with purpose. From solutions, to applications, integrations, coordination, communications, networks, products and beyond
