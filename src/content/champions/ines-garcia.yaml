    title: Why Your ESG Tech Stack Needs an Audit-Ready Makeover
    description: |
     " The gap between pretty reports and audit-ready architecture is massive. And 2025 is the year that gap becomes expensive. 

     Now we are talking on hashtag#ESG (as much the above applies to so many things!)
     When auditors ask "how did you calculate this?", can you trace every data point back to its source?

     From someone who's been in the trenches, I hope this piece brings some light and actions to get ready, and get ready now."

     The International Court of Justice (International Court of Justice (ICJ)) in The Hague, Netherlands, issued its advisory opinion on the obligations of States in respect of climate change, read out by the President of the Court, Judge Iwasawa Yuji, on Wednesday this very week.

     In multi-tenant architectures there is a line of responsibility and feasibility for one to make changes. That is where lobbing, supplier procurement commitments and public pressure can move the needle.

     'Don't wash your hands of' so quickly, that's not it.

     There are in fact things to account and adjust at instance level, that is OUR responsibility.

     And THAT (chances are you are part of that 'large segment of the software-development ecosystem that cares') would be my first action oriented call for you, head over the Green Web Foundation and particularly take the course that is hosted in Linux Foundation.

     In essence we all are to half our emissions by 2030. Regardless of pledges, this is UN target which is legally binding. 

     We ALL, humans, as an individual, household, hobby activity, village, city, council, county, country, industry, company, department, product, team... ain't exceptions--half our emissions in all dimensions.

     No small task. No time to waste.

     Software is everywhere. I argue is no longer 'an industry' per se, but a fabric layer of any business. The question then becomes: how to half your software emissions.

    description: Its so easy to get pigeonhole in one thing, one way of seeing, one experience, one industry, one process, one org... In this talk we are going beyond the Agile principles, I'll introduce you to Biomimicry. These principles are everywhere, you'll gain HD glasses to spot them and apply them for any design. So we can leave 'the place better than how we found it'.Understanding these natural overarching principles can really help to gain headspace and intentionally design with purpose. From solutions, to applications, integrations, coordination, communications, networks, products and beyond
