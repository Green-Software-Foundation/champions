     In multi-tenant architectures there is a line of responsibility and feasibility for one to make changes. That is where lobbing, supplier procurement commitments and public pressure can move the needle.

     'Don't wash your hands of' so quickly, that's not it.

     There are in fact things to account and adjust at instance level, that is OUR responsibility.

     Today I want to introduce you to The Salesforce Developer Carbon Dashboard

     And THAT (chances are you are part of that 'large segment of the software-development ecosystem that cares') would be my first action oriented call for you, head over the Green Web Foundation and particularly take the course that is hosted in Linux Foundation.

     In essence we all are to half our emissions by 2030. Regardless of pledges, this is UN target which is legally binding. 

     We ALL, humans, as an individual, household, hobby activity, village, city, council, county, country, industry, company, department, product, team... ain't exceptions--half our emissions in all dimensions.

     No small task. No time to waste.

     Software is everywhere. I argue is no longer 'an industry' per se, but a fabric layer of any business. The question then becomes: how to half your software emissions.

    description: To put it bluntly, we are facing big distress on water resources by our own miss-doing: economic development, inefficient and harmful water management practices, climate change, population growth... The disproportion between water supply and demand has an impact not only on the environment but also on human health, agricultural and industrial productivity, overall socio-economic development and many more beyond the '2 legged' or call it anthropocentric perspective.

     Join us to break down the jargon muddle. Evolving Value Stream Mapping (VSM) a very common Agile practice to take into account key variables for what we ought to achieve.

     Being sustainable is not just about the product itself. It’s also about the people, time, the energy involved in the process, and the consumption that its existence requires. If any single part of the process cannot be maintained over time, it’s unsustainablee.

    title: Disclosure & Compliance in Salesforce Net Zero Cloud
    description: |
     What I’d like to cover today is Disclosure and Compliance Hub. Which is a module within Net Zero Cloud for you to do exactly that: essentially this enables you to extract data, answer questions, collaborate with users, and generate disclosures.

     This matters as more and more clarity and transparency on Environmental and Social Impact is becoming essential. And well, legislation is happening, and potentially, tax and penalties may come down the line (the line is short, by the way!)

     So what this module enables you to do is to simply generate “formatted disclosures” that you can then report and publish.

    title: Your Instance Sustain-Ability
    description: |
     (One for any Salesforce professionals who care about our home, Earth)

     In a world that’s increasingly conscious of sustainability, we must weave it into the fabric of every facet of our lives, including our professional endeavours. What can I say? I’m biased, as more and more of what I do is tightly related to this.

     While we are familiar with the word, we should remind ourselves of its literal and important meaning – the ability to sustain.

     The Salesforce ecosystem has been around for a while, we even started a State of Salesforce Implementations series, and IMO it’s time to take our shared responsibility to the next level. Today, we’ll explore the concept of “Your Instance Sustain-Ability” within Salesforce and discover how you can make a difference in your everyday work.

     The realm of How / Behaviour / Being matters. 

     When change is constant, cultivating adaptable mindsets and approaches is key. While fixed goals might provide initial direction, they must harmonize with the ever-changing surroundings. Life is far from linear, and pretending otherwise just leads us to blind spots in the face of the real world's complexity.

     **Think about a time when a change in the external environment impacted your goals or plans. In hindsight how might an Agile mindset have helped navigate that situation?

     Large language models, such as GPT Bard & co, are revolutionizing the way we work and interact with technology. However, it is crucial to consider the importance of product ethics in this rapidly evolving landscape. As we harness the power of AI and language models, we must ask ourselves: Are we merely seeking "faster horses," or are we taking the opportunity to improve how we work and shape the future of work for the better?
     At its core, a large language model functions as a predictive tool, generating the next likely word based on past data. It's like predicting what comes next in a sentence. Sounds simple concept yeah?

     Climate change is both a complex and contentious issue.

     That requires effective communication and cooperation among individuals and groups with differing viewpoints. 

     When we engage in conversations about climate change, it's important to remember that the way we communicate can either open the door or slam it shut.

     To influence climate change conversations in a positive way that builds trust the key is to cultivate cooperative relationships (which happens to be a Biomimicry observed natural strategy to be locally attuned & responsive)

    title: "Ditching Scarcity: Let's Talk Climate"
    description: |
     Today "scarcity" seems to be the name of the game. We keep hearing that there's just not enough of anything. Time, money, knowledge, resources, influence, care, fancy tech, solutions at scale... 

     For the ones that care about this, it can feel like our efforts are crushed by 'everything else'  that surrounds us, whispering in our ears, "Sorry, but just not enough!" 

     Scarcity can come in many flavours, and when it comes to climate change, time is a key ingredient. We're in a race against it, no doubt. We need big changes, and we need them now. 

     Here is the thing: there's a difference between acknowledging the facts of scarcity and letting it mess with our heads (our triggered physical and mental reactions). Studies have shown that feeling the pinch of scarcity can seriously cramp our creativity. We are so focused on protecting what little we have that we shoot down ideas faster than a cheetah chasing its lunch. The trouble is that when we start believing we can't change anything, we then go into despair.
