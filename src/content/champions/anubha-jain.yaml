    title: Measuring the greenness of GIoT
    subtitle: QA&TEST Embedded 2023
    description: Green IoT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with our surroundings and reduce the environmental impact of our activities. However, to fully realize the potential of Green IoT, it is essential to measure its “greenness” and evaluate its impact on the environment. Measuring the greenness of Green IoT requires a holistic approach that takes into account various factors such as energy consumption, environmental impact, and user satisfaction. Measuring the greenness of Green IoT is a critical step in ensuring its success and sustainability. By using a holistic approach and appropriate testing techniques, we can evaluate its impact on the environment and make informed decisions.

    subtitle: HUSTEF 2023
    description: Green IoT has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with our surroundings and reduce the environmental impact of our activities. However, to fully realize the potential of Green IoT, it is essential to measure its “greenness” and evaluate its impact on the environment. Measuring the greenness of Green IoT requires a holistic approach that takes into account various factors such as energy consumption, environmental impact, and user satisfaction.  To measure the greenness of Green IoT, it is also important to use appropriate testing techniques and tools. This can include using energy profiling tools to monitor the energy consumption of the system, simulating different usage scenarios to evaluate its performance under different conditions, and performing user testing to evaluate its usability and effectiveness.

    title: Green IoT for Energy Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability
    description: The future challenge of IoT is to develop processes and policies that make sustainable use of IoT to reduce the greenhouse effect and carbon emissions, and also further optimise  IoT greenhouse footprint. IoT can be combined with technologies like AI, machine learning, computer vision, cloud computing, nanotechnology and big data to develop environmentally sustainable solutions for a better and fulfilled life. Greening of IoT focuses on manufacturing energy efficient IoT hardware as well as upon green software development, while Greening by IoT involves IoT as an enabler to create a sustainable environment.
