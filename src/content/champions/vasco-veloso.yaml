bio: |
 I've been building software for almost thirty years. From assembly, through C, C++, and Prolog, to Java, Scala, and Kotlin, on big and small computers, from floppy disks to SSDs, on-premises, IoT, and cloud, I can confidently say that I've touched on a bit of everything.

 This experience means that I've worked on environments where every byte and clock cycle mattered, and every little bit of energy saved was a win. I became interested in green software to attempt to counteract this cycle.

 I was one of the first persons to kickstart a Green IT initiative at ING's Daily Banking Netherlands in 2023. I also present talks within the organization and at conferences to promote green software.

 I'm also a theatrical improviser, amateur photographer, and a former ultralight student pilot.
