bio: |
 "I’m a South-African-born backend engineer currently based in Budapest, Hungary, where I lead the tech pillar of Data Immigrant LLC. My core stack is in Python Frameworks plus open source cloud-native tooling; I build mobile back-ends, web-based ERP systems, and data-science workflows that are both reliable and resource-efficient.

 Recent contributions (past 12 months)

 Jun – Aug 2025: Team leadership under TraceLab Mentorship (24 h/week, global, remote) – I designed and will co-lead a 3-month open-source program where participants build carbon-aware data pipelines and SDG dashboards for food-system transparency.	Upskills 30+ early-career data scientists.

 Jun 2025: Budapest Meetup Launch “Measuring the Carbon Impact of Software.” First Hungarian forum dedicated to green software; establishes a recurring local chapter under GSF guidelines.

 Why I seek Champion recognition:
 1.) Hungary’s tech community is hungry for guidance on sustainable software, listing in the Green Software Champions Directory would:
 Lend credibility that helps our new Budapest chapter attract venues, sponsors and guest speakers.
 2.) Signal quality to universities and corporate dev-rel teams as we embed the GSF Practitioner course in curricula.

 With a record of mentoring and proven team-lead experience, I’m ready to mobilise Central European developers toward software that serves both people and planet. "
