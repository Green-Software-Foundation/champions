    title: "Greening the Stack: Sustainable AI and Tech Infrastructure from Dev to Deploy"
    description: |
     "It was a privilege to be the keynote speaker to discuss a topic of growing importance — the intersection of climate action and the digital technology industry. I spoke about how it was our responsibility as professionals in this space we had the opportunity to ddress one of the defining challenges of our time: the climate crisis. I aimed to explore how our work in software could contribute meaningfully to global sustainability efforts, and how practical frameworks and community initiatives were making this vision a reality.
     The conversation covered the urgency of climate action in our field, the principles and practices of green software, practical frameworks for carbon reduction, the importance of ethical AI development, integrating sustainable DevOps practices — including scientific calculations within pipelines — and the role of community and collaboration in driving lasting change."

    title: Software Development and Environmental Sustainability
    description: |
     "I was presented with an opportunity to participate as an invited guest speaker at the recent event conducted by the University of Houston–Clear Lake. It was an honor to engage with students and faculty as an industry professional with over two decades of experience in delivering impactful technology solutions across the STEM disciplines.

     During my session, I aimed to provide students with a timely and meaningful perspective on the evolving relationship between software development and environmental sustainability. By introducing software carbon emissions as a non-functional requirement, I encouraged attendees to rethink how they design and build systems, emphasizing sustainability as an essential aspect of modern software architecture.

     I also had the opportunity to discuss the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) formula, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (Scopes 1, 2, and 3), and the practical tools offered by the Green Software Foundation. These resources, I believe, provide valuable, real-world strategies that students can carry forward into their future careers. My goal was to connect complex technical concepts with actionable sustainability practices in a way that was both accessible and impactful."

    title: Green Software - An Insight into Decarbonizing Software Solutions
    description: |
     "I delivered a presentation to the Application Development and IT Operations teams at my organization, with over 100 IT professionals joining from various locations across the United States. I used this opportunity to shed light on the topic of carbon emissions resulting from software-related activities and their broader environmental impact.

     During the session, I introduced practical methods for measuring our carbon footprint, highlighting real-time examples through the use of the Impact Framework. Additionally, I conducted a detailed demonstration covering the three core principles of Green Software: Energy Efficiency, Hardware Efficiency, and Carbon Awareness. It was a valuable platform to raise awareness and encourage more sustainable practices within our technology operations."

    title: Building Better Tech
    description: "I recently led an interactive workshop focused on the intersection of software development and sustainability. Rather than just diving into code, I challenged participants to think more critically about the environmental impact of the work we do in tech.
     Key Insights I Shared:
     The future of AI and quantum computing demands a more mindful approach to energy consumption and emissions.
     I explained how hardware serves as a proxy for carbon, and why increasing utilization and extending hardware lifespan are essential strategies.
     We explored the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (Scopes 1, 2, and 3), the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) formula, and how the Green Software Foundation's tools and frameworks can help us measure and reduce our carbon impact.
     One eye-opening takeaway: not all fast programs are carbon-efficient—the choice of programming language can make a real difference when it comes to sustainability.
     It was a powerful session aimed at equipping tech professionals with the knowledge to code more consciously and contribute to a greener digital future."
