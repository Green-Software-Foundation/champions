    title: Building Better Tech
    description: "I recently led an interactive workshop focused on the intersection of software development and sustainability. Rather than just diving into code, I challenged participants to think more critically about the environmental impact of the work we do in tech.
     Key Insights I Shared:
     The future of AI and quantum computing demands a more mindful approach to energy consumption and emissions.
     I explained how hardware serves as a proxy for carbon, and why increasing utilization and extending hardware lifespan are essential strategies.
     We explored the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (Scopes 1, 2, and 3), the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) formula, and how the Green Software Foundation's tools and frameworks can help us measure and reduce our carbon impact.
     One eye-opening takeaway: not all fast programs are carbon-efficient—the choice of programming language can make a real difference when it comes to sustainability.
     It was a powerful session aimed at equipping tech professionals with the knowledge to code more consciously and contribute to a greener digital future."
