bio: |
 I am the solution architect for the Sustainable IT Initiative Wavemakers at the Rabobank and was part of the 2024 Sustainable IT campagn of the Rabobank. Currently I'm setting up a IT4IT way of working with sustainability by design as a standard for the Rabobank organization.

 Love to attend Sustainable IT Meetups and for this year I am planning to present my IT4IT experiences with Sustainable IT by design in Meetups.
