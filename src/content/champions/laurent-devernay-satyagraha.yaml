bio: |
 I've been working in the sustainable IT field for a few years now and contributed to some repositories of best practices (https://gr491.isit-europe.org/).
 I also worked on the sustainability chapter for Web Almanac 2022 (https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability), a MOOC (https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/impacts-environnementaux-du-numerique/) and am part of the W3C working group on this topic (https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/). 
 Sustainable Software is my full-time job and I also teach this to students in engineering schools. 
 I am deeply convinced that sustainability can't be achieved without taking into account accessibility, inclusion, security, privacy and ethics as a whole.
