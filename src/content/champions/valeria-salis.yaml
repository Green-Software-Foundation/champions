bio: |
 I always describe myself as someone with a hybrid background and too many interests. My passion for technology ignited in my early years, when I'd toggle between a soccer ball and a "toy" PC, oblivious to the concept of "programming. In the end, I chose the latter path, I studied computer technology at school, I enrolled in Music Information Technology at University and during those years I discovered web development.
 I started off as a backend developer but then I switched to the dark side (front end, obviously). Along this journey, a particular sensibility lead me to become passionate about accessibility and sustainability.

    description: "The idea for this talk started with a question: "What if we lived in a world where we had to pay for the environmental impact of every digital activity? Would we make the same choices? Or not?". I then analyse some common digital activities and their environmental impacts such as writing/sending emails, watching a TV series on a streaming platform and so on."
