    title: Designing Energy Efficient Websites
    subtitle: with Claire Thornewill
    description: Designing energy efficient websites is an approach to designing digital products and services that are conscious of lowering carbon emissions by becoming more efficient. The choices we make in designing digital products, from UX design and development to the servers we use, can have a carbon cost and can contribute to global Greenhouse gases. In this session we would like to demonstrate our approach to designing and developing energy efficient websites and how we measure and calculate the carbon footprint of our clients websites.
