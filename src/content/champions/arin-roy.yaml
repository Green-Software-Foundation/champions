    title: Sustainability by design in your cloud Architecture
    description: |
     In cloud design, the advantages and impacts of cloud-hosted applications have typically been assessed through financial and efficiency metrics, and the Well-Architected Frameworks from the hyperscalers  follow this trend.
     Currently, organizations globally are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, seeking ways in which cloud technology can assist in reducing carbon emissions and minimizing their environmental impact to meet their sustainability objectives.
     In this session, we will explore how to create solutions that optimize resource utilization while minimizing waste, all grounded in the Well-Architected Framework as our technical foundation.

    title: Designing for Sustainability on Azure
    description: When designing for the cloud, the impact and benefits of a cloud hosted application have always been traditionally measured with financial and efficiency metrics. The Well Architected Framework for Azure has been no different.
     Right now, organizations around the world are putting a renewed focus on sustainability and are trying to understand how cloud can help organizations reduce their carbon emissions and lessen their environmental footprint to help them achieve their sustainability and environmental goals.
     In this session, we will look at how we can design solutions that maximize utilization but reduce waste while still using the Well-Architected Framework as a technical foundation.
