    title: How to create a green software culture at your company
    description: In today's climate-conscious world, technology companies have a responsibility to minimise their environmental impact. That includes the environmental impact of the software itself. 

     It can be easy to look at sustainability tips like building carbon aware products or reducing the size of webpages. But in large companies with complex systems, it can be hard to enact change. 

     As a green software advocate, I've learned that implementing sustainable practices doesn't require a complete system overhaul—it starts with small, actionable steps that create lasting change.
