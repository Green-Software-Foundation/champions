    title: Making Tech Work for Everyone - Podcast
    description: |
     Unlike in the private sector, governments don’t choose their users. That’s why even more important in the public sector to make sure that technology and digital transformation efforts work for everyone. It doesn’t matter how innovative or efficient digital technology can be for public institutions if the implementation of those actively exclude people from accessing and benefiting from public services and assets.
     That’s why principles like accessibility, sustainability and openness are so important when we think about digital transformation.
     Joining Ryan to talk about this is Mike Gifford, an Associate with Think Digital, and a Senior Strategist at CivicActions, a technology consultancy that helps government deliver better public services through modern technology and design.
