    title: Is green software on the agenda?
    description: Green software refers to all efforts to reduce the emissions of software. Companies need to adapt how software is designed, developed, deployed, and used to minimize its carbon footprint. Software runs on hardware, and any uptick in software use increases the emissions of machines and devices on which it runs. Green software practices can reduce energy consumption in multiple ways from programming and architecture choices to user experience.
