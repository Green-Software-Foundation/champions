    title: Green Waves Hackathon 2024
    description: |
     "Alarmed by a series of heatwaves and inspired by leading Delft University of Technology climate science professor Herman Russchenberg I initiated an international hackathon to promote sustainable innovation and community building.  For more info about how the hackathon idea was born, see:

     This hackathon, with main organizer TU Delft - Climate Action Programme, was a huge success, with over 160 participants from all over the world. The closing event on Friday, November 22nd, 2024, was a sustainability event in its own right. The Netherlands branch of Green Software Foundation supported the hackathon, as well as sponsors and co-organizers ilionx, Rabobank and Microsoft. 

     In this new year 2025, quarterly meetups are organized and we are considering making the hackathon a recurring annual event."
