bio: |
 I am the CCO and partner at Trail Openers, a software and data consultancy focusing on green software. The company currently employs 11 people. My background is in technology and business. I consult with our clients and prospects daily on green software and how they can embark on a more sustainable journey. Additionally, I continually refine our go-to-market strategy and value proposition to align with the market, actively promote the topic on LinkedIn, attend local events, and network globally. I have successfully sold numerous green software projects and established agreements with top companies in Finland aiming to deliver green software. I'm excited about the possibility of helping others and sharing with others how to create a business with green software.
