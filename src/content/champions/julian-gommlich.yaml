bio: |
 My name is Julian Gommlich and I am a software engineer currently living and working in Nuremberg, Germany. 
 I began my career as a requirements engineer in 2018 when I started my bachelor studies in IT systems and management. By the time I have finished my bachelor studies and continued with my master studies I already worked as a web software engineer.
 During my master studies I stumbled across Green IT which fascinated my right from the beginning. In 2022 I have joined the Green IT community in the company I am working at and gave my first presentations. In the following year I managed a Green IT research project about the energy consumption of different software architecture patterns. Multiple smaller projects followed since.
 A highlight of 2023 is that I was invited to contribute to an online course on Green IT by "Software Campus."
 Apart from these projects I also went on stage to present Green IT to people interested in IT. Since October 2024 I am also one of the hosts of a local meetup community on green software development in Nuremberg.
