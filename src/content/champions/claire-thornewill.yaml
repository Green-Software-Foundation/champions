    subtitle: Volunteer run project to research the awareness of IT's carbon footprint
    description: This is a project to understand whether businesses in climate are aware that IT also has a a carbon footprint. We are auditing 500 homepages of organisations with climate change in their business model, with the belief that if those who already strive towards a greener future are not aware that their IT has a carbon footprint, how can we hope that those who do not care about climate change, understand their IT has a carbon footprint.

In this session we would like to demonstrate our approach to designing and developing energy efficient websites and how we measure and calculate the carbon footprint of our clients websites.
